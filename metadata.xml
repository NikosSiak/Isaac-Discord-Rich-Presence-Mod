    <description>Better rich presence status.

[b]Important[/b]
Currently there is only windows support. For this mod to work you need to enable the debug flag (instructions below). This is needed because in order to communicate with discord I need to write to a special file and to do that I need the debug flag on. The flag is also used to get the time you started a run.

[b]Instructions[/b]
1. Right click the game in your library
2. Click &quot;Properties...&quot;
3. Click &quot;SET LAUNCH OPTIONS...&quot;
4. Write &quot;--luadebug&quot; on the input box and click OK
